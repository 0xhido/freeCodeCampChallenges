                            Deep within the Hidden Leaf Village, young ninja Naruto Uzumaki
                            carries sealed inside him the
                            Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit, which once almost destroyed the village. Always an outcast
                            because
                            of
                            his secret, now Naruto battles alongside his teammates Sasuke and Sakura to prove to
                            himself
                            and
                            everyone else that he's the greatest ninja ever. But he's got a long list of challenges
                            to
                            face
                            before he gets there!

                            Before the final round of the Chunin Exam, Naruto receives some
                            special training from the
                            legendary Toad Sage, Jiraiya. When the battles resume, Naruto is ready, but what about
                            Sasuke?
                            He's about to face the one ninja no one, not even Naruto thinks he can beat. But in the
                            midst of
                            everything, a sinister plot is set in motion, and the Village Hidden in the Leaves finds
                            itself
                            under attack!

                            Naruto returns from his training journey eager to see his friend
                            Sasuke. But Sasuke has only one
                            thing on his mind: his quest for revenge against his older brother. His unquenchable
                            thirst
                            for
                            power knows no bounds, and soon he is lured from the Leaf Village by Orochimaru's
                            minions,
                            the
                            Sound Four. Determined to get him back, Shikamaru and Naruto put together a team of the
                            top
                            genin in the village to go after him, and the chase begins!

                            In the Village Hidden in the Leaves, there are few things Naruto and
                            Choji love more than a
                            steaming bowl of Ichiraku ramen, and when the daughter of the owner is kidnapped,
                            they're on
                            the
                            case. Then, missions for the Leaf ninja lead them to the Land of Bears after a fallen
                            meteorite
                            and the Land of Greens to protect a princess. When an evil ninja who's after the
                            princess
                            gets
                            in their way, it's Naruto's life on the line!

                            In another world, ninja are the ultimate power, and in the Village
                            Hidden in the Leaves live the
                            stealthiest ninja in the land. Twelve years earlier, the fearsome Nine-Tailed Fox
                            terrorized
                            the
                            village and claimed many lives before it was subdued and its spirit sealed within the
                            body
                            of a
                            baby boy. That boy, Naruto Uzumaki, has grown up to become a ninja-in-training who's
                            more
                            interested in pranks than in studying ninjutsu.. but Naruto is determined to become the
                            greatest
                            ninja ever!
